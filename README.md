### About
This is the ***Unit Converter*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>When you travel, everything changes: people, languages, time zones, and even units. It may be difficult to read the temperature in Fahrenheit when you’ve always used Celsius, or to measure yourself in kilos if you’ve only used pounds. It’s no easy matter, though a nice unit converter could certainly help!</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3">Kotlin Developer</a></li>
</ul>

### Learning outcomes
<p>In this project, you will write a converter that handles distance, weight, and temperature units – all the traveller’s essentials. Get comfortable with the basics of coding: loops, conditions, and data input and output.</p>
